              You get direct access to ME. Got a question about a new lens
              you’re considering buying? Ask me. Having a hard time finding
              paying clients? Let’s chat strategy and tactics. Want feedback on
              a recent video? I’d love to review it and share my thoughts and
              feedback
      - heading: IS LCA REALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR LIFE?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              YES. It’s that simple. Buy once, learn and grow with myself and
              the community for life.
      - heading: ARE THERE HIDDEN FEES?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              Not a single one. The price you see even includes tax so it’s just
              that one time fee.
      - heading: 'LCA IS A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT, WILL I GET MY MONEYS WORTH?'
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>LCA now has roughly 500 members and each and everyone of them
              have raved of the insane amount of value they got for their
              investment. And because the academy&rsquo;s content grows daily,
              your investment only becomes more worthwhile by the day. I am so
              confident you will LOVE LCA that I even have a 30 day money back
              guarantee so it&rsquo;s RISK FREE. When you land your first paying
              client because of LCA and break the many months of slow social
              growth, this will become the best investment you&rsquo;ve ever
              made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;LCA is worth every dollar! I love
              the community and I am already seeing progress in my work&rdquo;

      - heading: CAN I PAY MONTHLY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>Yes! We have recently launched a payment plan allowing you to
              break up the payments.</p>
      - heading: IS LCA ABOUT TRAVEL?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>NO - This is a common misconception. LCA shows you how to
              create AMAZING travel content but these lessons are 100% relevant
              no matter what genre or category of content you create. If you are
              a personal trainer, a beauty vlogger, a food blogger or really
              anyone that wants to grow your online presence and elevate your
              brand with beautiful content, then LCA is for you!</p>

          WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER TAKING THIS
          ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>If you go on to practice the business and creative skills
              taught in LCA, you will be ready to start earning thousands of
              dollars as a freelance videographer and photographer from
              ANYWHERE.</p>
      - heading: WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE PRIVATE LCA COMMUNITY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>Dozens of LCA members have told me that their favourite things
              about LCA is this community group. It has enabled members from
              around the world to collaborate, plan trips together, and support
              one another in growing their businesses. It has enabled members to
              be able to share this unique journey with likeminded individuals
              who they would not have been able to find otherwise. In addition
              to community, this is where you can ask your questions, get
              feedback on your work, and join in on the countless Creator
              Challenges we host in the exclusive community group!</p>
      - heading: >-
          WILL THIS ACADEMY BE TOO ADVANCED FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER PICKED UP
          A CAMERA BEFORE?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>ANYONE can enter LCA and with time and practice become a true
              professional. It&rsquo;s built for any skill level!</p>
      - heading: >-
          I ALREADY HAVE STARTED MAKING VIDEOS AND DOING PHOTOGRAPHY; IS THIS
          ACADEMY STILL FOR ME?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>If you have a head start, then that is fantastic because we
              have a ton of high-level editing tutorials, business mastery and
              creator challenges that will take your current skills and push
              them to improve. LCA is built for any skill level!</p>
      - heading: HOW MANY VIDEOS ARE IN THE ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>At the moment there are around 50 videos and 25 hours of
              information packed content.</p>
      - heading: HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE ACADEMY FOR?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>This is my new full-time job. Content will continue to grow for
              many years to come and there is no end in sight.</p>
      - heading: WHAT GEAR AND SOFTWARE DO I NEED FOR THIS ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>You can start today without any software by focusing on the
              business modules and even some of the creative basics but when
              it&rsquo;s time to dive in to editing, you will need a way to
              edit. You can certainly start with free editing software for
              mobile phones and computers however I recommend you get started
              with Adobe&rsquo;s creative suite (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere
              Pro) or FinalCut Pro X</p>
