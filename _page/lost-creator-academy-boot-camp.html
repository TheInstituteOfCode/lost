      <p>This is my story of how a camera changed my life. It helped me escape a
      9-5 that drained the joy of my day to day. It allowed me to see the world
      and share it with my loved ones. It enabled me to build a million-dollar
      business from the road. But most of all, it enabled me to make a living
      doing what I love. Every single day. I want this to become your story and
      that is why I built LCA. The social media and content creator industry is
      full of opportunity if you have the skills and know-how and that is why on
      March 1st, I will show you how to make your dream life your reality.</p>
