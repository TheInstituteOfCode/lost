        text_html: >-
          <p>My name is Christian and I&rsquo;m a 26 year old from Canada living
          in Bali. Five years ago, I was working a 9-5 job that was considered
          to be the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; opportunity but somehow found myself
          depressed and drained. In that difficult time, I learned the most
          important lesson of my life. I discovered that no amount of money or
          success would make me happy if I wasn&rsquo;t doing what I loved. So,
          I quit. I sold everything I owned and bought a 1-way ticket to
          Thailand with no money, no real skills as a content creator and NO
          idea what I was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spent the next 5
          years making a ton of mistakes and a few great decisions. Through this
          trial and error, I have been able to build a 7-figure business by age
          25, see the world with my loved ones, and work with some of my
          favorite brands. But most of all, I&rsquo;ve been able to earn my
          dream income by doing something I would have done for free. Now, let's
          help you do the same.</p>
