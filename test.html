      <p>&ldquo;Just wanted to say thank you again Christian for everything you
      do! You&rsquo;ve completely changed my life in a great and 360 kinda way!
      I quit my job to travel last year and now on the verge of quitting to move
      to SE Asia! Thank you again for all you do - A True #teamgetlost fan,
      Chris&rdquo;</p><p>Today, with 45K on Instagram and 10K on YouTube, Chris
      has leveraged his social media channels to make a FULL TIME living as a
      content creator. He has been able to travel around the world and
      experience some of the most exclusive resorts and activities and to share
      them with his soon to be wife who he met while traveling Thailand.</p>

      <p>Rewind just two or so years ago, Chris was working with LinkedIn as a
      sales associate until he came across the Lost LeBlanc channel and through
      that, he stumbled onto my former Patreon channel where I taught some of
      the principles of running a business as a content creator. Chris took
      these early teachings and paired them with his incredible work-ethic to
      quit his job, leave San Francisco and become his own boss overnight. Chris
      (@seelautravel) is living his dream life and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier
      for him.</p><p>I hope to help you take a hold of your dream life because
      with hard work, the right mentorship and support, this can be YOU.</p>

        text_html: >-
          <p>My name is Christian and I&rsquo;m a 26 year old from Canada living
          in Bali. Five years ago, I was working a 9-5 job that was considered
          to be the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; opportunity but somehow found myself
          depressed and drained. In that difficult time, I learned the most
          important lesson of my life. I discovered that no amount of money or
          success would make me happy if I wasn&rsquo;t doing what I loved. So,
          I quit. I sold everything I owned and bought a 1-way ticket to
          Thailand with no money, no real skills as a content creator and NO
          idea what I was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spent the next 5
          years making a ton of mistakes and a few great decisions. Through this
          trial and error, I have been able to build a 7-figure business by age
          25, see the world with my loved ones, and work with some of my
          favorite brands. But most of all, I&rsquo;ve been able to earn my
          dream income by doing something I would have done for free. Now, let's
          help you do the same.</p>

              <p>LCA now has roughly 500 members and each and everyone of them
              have raved of the insane amount of value they got for their
              investment. And because the academy&rsquo;s content grows daily,
              your investment only becomes more worthwhile by the day. I am so
              confident you will LOVE LCA that I even have a 30 day money back
              guarantee so it&rsquo;s RISK FREE. When you land your first paying
              client because of LCA and break the many months of slow social
              growth, this will become the best investment you&rsquo;ve ever
              made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;LCA is worth every dollar! I love

              <p>NO - This is a common misconception. LCA shows you how to
              create AMAZING travel content but these lessons are 100% relevant
              no matter what genre or category of content you create. If you are
              a personal trainer, a beauty vlogger, a food blogger or really
              anyone that wants to grow your online presence and elevate your
              brand with beautiful content, then LCA is for you!</p>

              <p>You can start today without any software by focusing on the
              business modules and even some of the creative basics but when
              it&rsquo;s time to dive in to editing, you will need a way to
              edit. You can certainly start with free editing software for
              mobile phones and computers however I recommend you get started
              with Adobe&rsquo;s creative suite (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere
              Pro) or FinalCut Pro X</p>
