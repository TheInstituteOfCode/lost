          <p>My name is Christian and I&rsquo;m a 27 year old Canadian living in
          Bali.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Five years ago,</strong> I was working a 9-5
          job that was considered to be the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; job but somehow
          found myself depressed and drained. I discovered that no amount of
          money or success would make me happy if <strong>I wasn&rsquo;t doing
          what I loved</strong><strong>...</strong></p><p><strong>So, I
          quit.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I sold everything I owned and bought a
          1-way ticket to Thailand with no money, no skills as a content creator
          and NO idea what I was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>My goal was to<strong>
          become a </strong><strong>world-class content
          creator</strong><strong>&nbsp;and NEVER go back to a 9-5
          job.</strong></p><p>Over the last 5 years, I've taken a lot of wrong
          turns and made a lot of mistakes but in doing so, I discovered how to
          achieve&nbsp;<strong>financial freedom </strong>as a
          creator.&nbsp;</p><p>I've traveled the world with loved ones, built a
          supportive community of over 3 million people and the crazy part,
          <strong>I&rsquo;ve been able to earn millions of dollars by doing
          something I would have done for
          free.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m here to help YOU do the
          same.</strong></p>

          <p>Imagine a life where <strong>YOU are paid thousands of
          dollars</strong> to capture beautiful moments while you travel the
          world?&nbsp;</p><p>To be able to <strong>work from an island, a
          foreign city, or really anywhere your laptop can connect to
          wifi</strong>. Now I want you to imagine being able to share the
          things that matter most to you with the rest of the world and to get
          paid for doing it. Well, you don&rsquo;t have to dream it because
          becoming a full-time content creator has never been more within reach
          than TODAY with Lost Creator Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few
          years, I have built a <strong>million dollar social media
          business</strong> that is followed by over 3 million people and has
          been watched by over 200 million viewers and all that was done from
          exotic destinations around the world with a laptop.<strong>
          </strong>I&rsquo;ve been able to work with some of my favorite brands
          like Google, Samsung, DJI, Air Canada, Nikon, and THE CRAZY thing is,
          I make incredible money doing it.</p><p>The Lost LeBlanc business has
          given me a life I could have never imagined in my wildest dreams
          and<strong> it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I was trapped in a 9-5 job
          that robbed me of joy and took me to a really dark
          place.</strong></p><p>I wanted to help more people make money doing
          what they LOVE instead of what makes their boss happy.&nbsp;</p><p>So,
          I decided to&nbsp; breakdown EVERYTHING I&rsquo;ve learned, to teach
          you how to do the exact same thing so that YOU TOO can start living
          your best life.&nbsp;</p><p>After spending over a YEAR building Lost
          Creator Academy, I am finally ready to <strong>give you access to my
          entire business</strong>, <strong>workflows,</strong> <strong>secret
          tools</strong>, <strong>hacks</strong>, <strong>templates</strong>,
          <strong>walkthroughs</strong>, <strong>tutorials</strong>, and the
          exact roadmap you can follow to live an incredible life full of
          travel, passion, and self-made wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

          I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you are afraid
          to pick up that camera because you don&rsquo;t even know where to
          start! Or, maybe you&rsquo;ve been posting videos and photos for years
          and have never really gotten the traction you deserve. And lastly,
          maybe the moment you ask a client to pay, they simply walk away (this
          one used to hurt me the most...).&nbsp;</p><p>And lastly, maybe the
          moment you ask a client to pay, they simply walk away (this one used

          well. Luckily, I found ways to overcome each and everyone one of them

          program <strong>will teach you step-by-step</strong> exactly what you
          need to do to become successful and very profitable on social media

          Christian, Lost LeBlanc am ready to be your mentor.</strong></p><p>If
          you are ready to make your passion your career and start monetizing
          the content you create then here&rsquo;s what you can
          expect:</p><p>First of all, you get access to an ever-expanding
          academy of over 100 videos and masterclasses. That&rsquo;s roughly 40
          hours of information packed videos. And NO, these are not boring,
          drawn-out videos like you see on youtube. I only deliver the quality
          information that MATTERS.</p>

          <p>I remember one of my early contracts charging myself out at 500 USD
          when a smaller channel did the same campaign for 5K USD. I remember
          launching my first product only to sell it to 10 people on the opening
          day because I had no idea what I was doing! And I remember how much
          that amount of money meant to a broke backpacker back in the day, but
          if I had had the support and knowledge of LCA early on, this
          investment would have returned itself in so many ways that this amount
          would have easily been one of the best investments I could have made
          in myself and in my career.</p><p>Because I understand how this
          investment may feel to you, I invite you to try out the academy with a
          30-day money-back guarantee. If after 30 days, it&rsquo;s not for you,
          just let me know why the academy wasn&rsquo;t for you and you get your
          money back (as long as you haven&rsquo;t watched 50% or more of the
          academy).</p>

      - heading: IS LCA ABOUT TRAVEL?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>NO - This is a common misconception. LCA shows you how to
              create AMAZING travel content but these lessons are 100% relevant
              no matter what genre or category of content you create. If you are
              a personal trainer, a beauty vlogger, a food blogger or really
              anyone that wants to grow your online presence and elevate your
              brand with beautiful content, then LCA is for you!</p>
      - heading: HOW DOES THE MENTORSHIP WORK?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              You get direct access to ME. Got a question about a new lens
              you’re considering buying? Ask me. Having a hard time finding
              paying clients? Let’s chat strategy and tactics. Want feedback on
              a recent video? I’d love to review it and share my thoughts and
              feedback
      - heading: IS LCA REALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR LIFE?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              YES. It’s that simple. Buy once, learn and grow with myself and
              the community for life.
      - heading: ARE THERE HIDDEN FEES?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              Not a single one. The price you see even includes tax so it’s just
              that one time fee.
      - heading: 'LCA IS A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT, WILL I GET MY MONEYS WORTH?'
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>LCA now has over 1000 members and each and everyone of them
              have raved of the insane amount of value they got for their
              investment. And because the academy&rsquo;s content grows daily,
              your investment only becomes more worthwhile by the day. I am so
              confident you will LOVE LCA that I even have a 30 day money back
              guarantee (as long as you haven&rsquo;t watched 50% or more of the
              academy) so it&rsquo;s RISK FREE. When you land your first paying
              client because of LCA and break the many months of slow social
              growth, this will become the best investment you&rsquo;ve ever
              made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;LCA is worth every dollar! I love
              the community and I am already seeing progress in my work&rdquo;

      - heading: CAN I PAY MONTHLY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>Yes! We have recently launched a payment plan allowing you to
              break up the payments.</p>
      - heading: >-
          WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER TAKING THIS
          ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>If you go on to practice the business and creative skills
              taught in LCA, you will be ready to start earning thousands of
              dollars as a freelance videographer and photographer from
              ANYWHERE.</p>
      - heading: WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE PRIVATE LCA COMMUNITY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>Dozens of LCA members have told me that their favourite things
              about LCA is this community group. It has enabled members from
              around the world to collaborate, plan trips together, and support
              one another in growing their businesses. It has enabled members to
              be able to share this unique journey with likeminded individuals
              who they would not have been able to find otherwise. In addition
              to community, this is where you can ask your questions, get
              feedback on your work, and join in on the countless Creator
              Challenges we host in the exclusive community group!</p>
      - heading: >-
          WILL THIS ACADEMY BE TOO ADVANCED FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER PICKED UP
          A CAMERA BEFORE?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>ANYONE can enter LCA and with time and practice become a true
              professional. It&rsquo;s built for any skill level!</p>
      - heading: >-
          I ALREADY HAVE STARTED MAKING VIDEOS AND DOING PHOTOGRAPHY; IS THIS
          ACADEMY STILL FOR ME?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>If you have a head start, then that is fantastic because we
              have a ton of high-level editing tutorials, business mastery and
              creator challenges that will take your current skills and push
              them to improve. LCA is built for any skill level!</p>
      - heading: HOW MANY VIDEOS ARE IN THE ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>At the moment there are over 100 videos and more than 40 hours
              of information-packed content.</p>
      - heading: HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE ACADEMY FOR?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>This is my new full-time job. Content will continue to grow for
              many years to come and there is no end in sight.</p>
      - heading: WHAT GEAR AND SOFTWARE DO I NEED FOR THIS ACADEMY?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>You can start today without any software by focusing on the
              business modules and even some of the creative basics but when
              it&rsquo;s time to dive in to editing, you will need a way to
              edit. You can certainly start with free editing software for
              mobile phones and computers however I recommend you get started
              with Adobe&rsquo;s creative suite (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere
              Pro) or FinalCut Pro X</p>
      - heading: DO I NEED TO QUIT MY JOB?
        list_item:
          - text_html: >-
              <p>No! It is unrealistic to immediately drop all your
              responsibilities to chase your dreams BUT that is why I will teach
              you how to build the skills as quickly as possible until you are
              ready to make the jump into being a full-time content creator.</p>
