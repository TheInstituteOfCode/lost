        heading: CHRISTIAN LEBLANC
        text_html: >-
          <p>My name is Christian and I&rsquo;m a 27 year old Canadian living in
          Bali. Five years ago, I was working a 9-5 job that was considered to
          be the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; job but somehow found myself depressed and
          drained. I discovered that no amount of money or success would make me
          happy if I wasn&rsquo;t doing what I loved.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I quit. I
          sold everything I owned and bought a 1-way ticket to Thailand with no
          money, no skills as a content creator and NO idea what I was
          doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last 5 years, I have made a ton of
          mistakes and a few great decisions. I have built Lost LeBlanc into a
          million dollar business, I&rsquo;ve traveled the world with my loved
          ones, and shared it all with a community of over 3 million people. But
          most of all, I&rsquo;ve been able to earn my dream income by doing
          something I would have done for free. I&rsquo;m here to help YOU do
          the same.</p>
