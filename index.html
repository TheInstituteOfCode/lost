          <p>If you are picking up a camera for the first time then no stress! I
          deep dive into the basics of using your camera, understanding the
          different software options for editing your photos and videos and
          which is likely best for you. I even break-down what camera gear is

          behind the lens reality on how I shoot my photos AND the in-studio
          tutorials to show you how I edit them. From colour grading in
          Lightroom to sky replacements in Photoshop, these are the skills that
          will empower you to land your dream clients and start building your
          online following.</p>

          <p>Get PAID to work with your DREAM clients - Believe it or not, you
          don&rsquo;t need a following to start making money today but you do
          need strategy. In this section I teach you how to negotiate and price
          yourself, how to get free hotels and experiences to keep costs low and
          of course, how to build up multiple income sources. Lost LeBlanc
          became a million dollar business through diversifying revenue streams
          and applying the strategies I share with you.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just wanted to say thank you again Christian for everything you
      do! You&rsquo;ve completely changed my life in a great and 360 kinda way!
      I quit my job to travel last year and now on the verge of quitting to move
      to SE Asia! Thank you again for all you do - A True #teamgetlost fan,
      Chris&rdquo;</p><p>Today, with 45K on Instagram and 10K on YouTube, Chris
      has leveraged his social media channels to make a FULL TIME living as a
      content creator. He has been able to travel around the world and
      experience some of the most exclusive resorts and activities and to share
      them with his soon to be wife who he met while traveling Thailand.</p>

      <p>Rewind just two or so years ago, Chris was working with LinkedIn as a
      sales associate until he came across the Lost LeBlanc channel and through
      that, he stumbled onto my former Patreon channel where I taught some of
      the principles of running a business as a content creator. Chris took
      these early teachings and paired them with his incredible work-ethic to
      quit his job, leave San Francisco and become his own boss overnight. Chris
      (@seelautravel) is living his dream life and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier
      for him.</p><p>I hope to help you take a hold of your dream life because
      with hard work, the right mentorship and support, this can be YOU.</p>

        text_html: >-
          <p>My name is Christian and I&rsquo;m a 26 year old from Canada living
          in Bali. Five years ago, I was working a 9-5 job that was considered
          to be the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; opportunity but somehow found myself
          depressed and drained. In that difficult time, I learned the most
          important lesson of my life. I discovered that no amount of money or
          success would make me happy if I wasn&rsquo;t doing what I loved. So,
          I quit. I sold everything I owned and bought a 1-way ticket to
          Thailand with no money, no real skills as a content creator and NO
          idea what I was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spent the next 5
          years making a ton of mistakes and a few great decisions. Through this
          trial and error, I have been able to build a 7-figure business by age
          25, see the world with my loved ones, and work with some of my
          favorite brands. But most of all, I&rsquo;ve been able to earn my
          dream income by doing something I would have done for free. Now, let's
          help you do the same.</p>

              Not a single one. The price you see even includes tax so it’s just
              that one time fee.

              LCA now has roughly 500 members and each and everyone of them have
              raved of the insane amount of value they got for their investment.
              And because the academy’s content grows daily, your investment
              only becomes more worthwhile by the day. I am so confident you
              will LOVE LCA that I even have a 30 day money back guarantee so
              it’s RISK FREE. When you land your first paying client because of
              LCA and break the many months of slow social growth, this will
              become the best investment you’ve ever made.
