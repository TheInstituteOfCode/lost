          <p>If you are picking up a camera for the first time then no stress! I
          deep dive into the basics of using your camera, understanding the
          different software options for editing your photos and videos and
          which is likely best for you. I even break-down what camera gear is

          behind the lens reality on how I shoot my photos AND the in-studio
          tutorials to show you how I edit them. From colour grading in
          Lightroom to sky replacements in Photoshop, these are the skills that
          will empower you to land your dream clients and start building your
          online following.</p>

          <p>Get PAID to work with your DREAM clients - Believe it or not, you
          don&rsquo;t need a following to start making money today but you do
          need strategy. In this section I teach you how to negotiate and price
          yourself, how to get free hotels and experiences to keep costs low and
          of course, how to build up multiple income sources. Lost LeBlanc
          became a million dollar business through diversifying revenue streams
          and applying the strategies I share with you.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just wanted to say thank you again Christian for everything you
      do! You&rsquo;ve completely changed my life in a great and 360 kinda way!
      I quit my job to travel last year and now on the verge of quitting to move
      to SE Asia! Thank you again for all you do - A True #teamgetlost fan,
      Chris&rdquo;</p><p>Today, with 45K on Instagram and 10K on YouTube, Chris
      has leveraged his social media channels to make a FULL TIME living as a
      content creator. He has been able to travel around the world and
      experience some of the most exclusive resorts and activities and to share
      them with his soon to be wife who he met while traveling Thailand.</p>

      <p>Rewind just two or so years ago, Chris was working with LinkedIn as a
      sales associate until he came across the Lost LeBlanc channel and through
      that, he stumbled onto my former Patreon channel where I taught some of
      the principles of running a business as a content creator. Chris took
      these early teachings and paired them with his incredible work-ethic to
      quit his job, leave San Francisco and become his own boss overnight. Chris
      (@seelautravel) is living his dream life and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier
      for him.</p><p>I hope to help you take a hold of your dream life because
      with hard work, the right mentorship and support, this can be YOU.</p>
